# Validation — Dominican Republic Wind (`dominican-republic-wind`)

Last updated: 2026-06-17 · Sprint: S1 + HB integration · Paper section: Technical Validation §4.2

## Source

- **Region id:** `dominican-republic-wind`
- **Country:** DOM
- **Tier:** estimated
- **Kind:** wind
- **Source:** IRENA Dominican Republic 2024 (448 MW wind; OC does not publish per-fuel curtailment; estimated 0.3 TWh/yr from capacity + typical wind profile)
- **Source URL:** [https://www.oc.org.do/](https://www.oc.org.do/)
- **Loader:** _(no single-file loader — see multi-region source)_
- **Structural gap:** no

## Calibration

- **Rate source documented in:** `docs/methodology/` (see links below)
- **Uniform across backfill years:** n/a — no backfill

## Multi-year backfill annual totals

| Year | Backfill rows | Backfill annual TWh | Published TSO annual TWh | Δ % | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(no backfill or TSO anchors yet — will be populated after HB fan-out completes)_ | | | | | |

## Published anchors

- **TSO annual curtailment (latest published):** —
- **Ember annual:** —
- **IRENA annual:** —
- **Other:** —

## Discrepancy analysis

_New region (granularity survey expansion, PR #206). Modelled from a capacity/literature anchor; promote when a machine-readable operator curtailment series becomes reachable._

## Known limitations

- Magnitude is a modelled estimate (typical wind shape × an annual anchor), not a measured curtailment series. ±40% T3 envelope.
